		- Format: JSON file

		- Example:
			
			Natural language processing is an essential part of many types of technology, including voice assistance, chat bots, and improving sentiment analysis. NLP analytics empowers computers to understand human speech in text and/or written form without needing the person to structure their conversation in a specific way. They can talk or type naturally, and the NLP system interprets what they’re asking about from there.

		- Format:
		
			- JSON file where we have concepts, every concept has a list of nouns, adjectives, etc.
